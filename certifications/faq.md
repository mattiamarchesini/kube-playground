The Linux Foundation has a zero tolerance rule in regard to anyone who engages in Exam Misconduct. The exams are
administered under strict supervision and exam rules, and are carefully monitored during the live exam, and upon
completion of the exam, the session recording is reviewed. Any suspicious activity will be addressed and will result in
consequences including, but not limited to, revoking a passing score and restricting an individual’s ability to take an
exam again.
